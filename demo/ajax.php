/**
 * This file shows how the AJAX data for a DataTable is rendered.
 * 
 * By default this file is configured to load the data from a CSV file using the CsvBrowserService. 
 * This can be switched to use the DbBrowserService which will load the data from a MySQL database.
 *  
 * This demonstrates how your DataTable doesn't need to be tied to any specific database implementation, etc.
 * Thus, you can use your application's existing ORM, services, etc. to deal with the data 
 * and your DataTable doesn't need to care about where the data came from as long as it's
 * provided an array of entity objects.
