/**
 * This example demonstrates how to use a DataTable for displaying
 * data pulled from a server through an ajax request.
 * 
 * Be sure to download the DataTables jQuery plugin from http://http://datatables.net/download/
 * and extract it within this folder
 * 
 * Look at ajax.php to see how the data is pulled for the table. By default it is configured
 * to load the data from a CSV file using the CsvBrowserService. This can be switched to use
 * the DbBrowserService which will load the data from a MySQL database. This demonstrates
 * how your DataTable doesn't need to be tied to any specific database implementation, etc.
 * Thus, you can use your application's existing ORM, services, etc. to deal with the data 
 * and your DataTable doesn't need to care about where the data came from as long as it's
 * provided an array of entity objects.
